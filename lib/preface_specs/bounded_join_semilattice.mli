(** A [Join_semilattice] capture the notion of a set with
    {b least upper bound} with a { bottom }. A bounded join semilattice is an idempotent commutative
    semigroup.
    {2 Laws}
    To have a predictable behaviour, the instance of [Bounded_join_semilattice] must
    obey some laws.

    - [join a a = a]
